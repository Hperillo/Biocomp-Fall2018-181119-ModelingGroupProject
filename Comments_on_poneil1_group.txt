#### COMMENTS FROM HELEN, VY, AND HENRY for PATRICK, SAURY, ALEXIS ####

Put all names on the document.

Move conversion efficiency arrow to come out of predators, displaying the loss of energy.

Add self-limiting prey arrow to Rosen-Mac model.

Distinguish Rosen-Mac pararmeter paragraph by each value (i.e. make a new paragraph each time rather than have one massive parameter).

Use Rosen-Mac formatting for model labelling in Lotka-Volterra model labelling (i.e. be consistent in captioning)

Good format for paradox of enrichment section!

Make conceptual model screenshots less fuzzy (if possible).

Annotate script more.

Add variable changes (if possible).

Well labelled.
