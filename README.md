## Biocomputing-Fall2018: Dynamic Modeling Group Project

See Modeling_GroupProjectDescription.pdf for full instructions.

Once completed, submit your final group project via a pull request. The pull request should be titled with the last names of all group members (ie "Jones-Bertolet-Rivaldi")

Documents to submit for final project include:
- One .R or .py script with code for the entire project. Code should be well commented and run from beginning to end. 
- One .docx report. This should include conceptual diagrams, generated plots, interpretation of simulations, and answers to the discussion questions. Conceptual diagrams can be create in Powerpoint and exported as a .pdf or .png. Plots can be exported from R or python as a .pdf or .png using ggsave().
