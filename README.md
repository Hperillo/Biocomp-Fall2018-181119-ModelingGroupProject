## See Modeling_GroupProjectDescription.pdf for full instructions.

## Once completed, submit your final group project via a pull request. The pull request should be titled with the last names of all group members (ie "Jones-Bertolet-Rivaldi")

## Documents to submit for final project include:
- One .R or .py script with code for the entire project. Code should be well commented and run from beginning to end. 
- One .docx report. This should include generated plots, interpretation of simulations, and answers to the discussion questions. Plots can be exported from R or python as a .pdf or .png using ggsave().
